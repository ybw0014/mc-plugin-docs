# Collecting Resources

You've almost made it to the end of the wiki, congratulations! Fortunately, this
last step doesn't need its own mini lesson in genetics to explain. ðŸ˜…

The final step in producing recources with chickens is to craft an **Excitation Chamber**.

The Excitation Chamber is what activates these recessive genes and
allows resources to be harvested from your chicken. Each recessive allele will
play a part in how fast a resource is generated: the fewer there are, the faster
it will go. For the standard Excitation Chamber, this means that while a
`BBCCDDFFSSWW` feather chicken will give one feather every 2 seconds, a
`bbccddffssww` Netherite chicken will take a full 20 seconds per ingot. This
also affects chickens of the same type. Each *heterozygous* gene a chicken has
will add 2 seconds to the overall generation time. Therefore, while a
`bbccDDFSSWW` coal chicken will generate 1 coal every 8 seconds, a
`bbccDDFfSsWW` coal chicken will take 12 seconds, and a `bbccDdFfSsWw` coal
chicken will take 16 seconds. While having various *heterozygous* genes in a
chicken may be advantageous in some breeding situations, they do nothing but
hinder the recource generation process, so be sure to selectively breed your
resource chickens to avoid *heterozygous* genes. Below is a table of the range
of processing times for each tier of chicken in both the standard and the
Boosted Excitation Chambers:

.      | Standard | Boosted (x2)
------ | -------- | ------------
Tier 0 |   2-14   |     1-7
Tier 1 |   5-15   |     2-7
Tier 2 |   8-16   |     4-8
Tier 3 |  11-17   |     5-8
Tier 4 |  14-18   |     7-9
Tier 5 |  17-19   |     8-9
Tier 6 |    20    |      10

The base processing time can be configured in the config file, it may different on your server.

## You now know everything there is to know about breeding chickens

Good luck!
