# Strainer

Strainer is an early game tool to gather resources from water.

<ImageGallery images={[

]} />

To gather resources from strainer, you will need a **Strainer Base** and any type of **Strainer**.

## Usage

Put the Strainer Base in the water, or anywhere else then make it [waterlogged](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Waterlogging).

Then, put in a Strainer to start gathering resources.

<details>
<summary>How to place cargo node on a strainer base?</summary>

You cannot place cargo node on a waterlogged strainer base directly. However, you can do the following:

1. Break the Strainer Base, place a chest at the same location.
2. Place the cargo node on the side of the chest.
3. Replace the chest with the Strainer Base.

## Information

There are 3 tiers of Strainer:

| Tier | Chance |
| ---- | ------ |
| Basic | 30% |
| Advanced | 60% |
| Reinforced | 90% |

* The chance is rolled each time the Strainer Base operates. If it fails, the Strainer will not lose any durability, but cannot gather any resources.

### Strainer Durability

Every strainer have the same durability: 64.

Each run has chance to reduce the durability by 1.

The chance is calculated by this formula:

$$
\frac{1}{1 + 3 \cdot U + M}
$$

Where:

- $U$ is the level of **Unbreaking** enchantment on the Strainer.
- $M$ is the level of **Mending** enchantment on the Strainer.

:::warning

**Unbreakable** attribute will not work on Strainer.
