# Quarry

Quarry is an electric machine that generates resources from thin air.

## Usage

*(Optional)* You can put an [Oscillator](/infinity-expansion-2/tools/oscillator) in the input slot to increase the chance to obtain specific resource.

## Information

There are 4 tiers of Quarry:

| Tier | Speed* | Chance | Energy consumption (J/t) |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Basic | 1 | 15% | 300 |
| Advanced | 2 | 25% | 900 |
| Void | 4 | 50% | 3,600 |
| Infinity | 64 | 100% | 36,000 |

- The **Speed** is how many items are generated per run.
- **Chance** is configurable.
- You can also disable a specific quarry in a specific world type. For example, if your server has multiple Overworlds, and you want to disable Basic Quarry in all the Overworlds, you can disable it in the [item specific configurations](/infinity-expansion-2/config/items) instead of in each world's config.

:::info default values

Some of these information can be changed in the [item specific configurations](/infinity-expansion-2/config/items) by server owners. The wiki only shows the default values. Check the actual information in-game.

## How does Quarry work?

1. The Quarry will select the pool (defined in [config](/infinity-expansion-2/config/main#quarry-pools)) according to the current world type (Overworld, Nether, End).
2. The **Chance** of Quarry will determine if the Quarry should pick an item from the pool.
3. If the Quarry should not pick from pool, the base product will be generated instead, and the output procedure ends here.
4. The Quarry will check if there is a valid Oscillator in the input slot. If there is, the Quarry will pick an item from the pool according to the Oscillator's settings.

## Understanding In-game Guide

<ImageGallery images={[

The above image shows one pool of Quarry in the Slimefun Guide.

The top left icon indicates this is a Overworld pool. The bottom left item is the **base product**, and the amount of base product is the **Speed** of the Quarry.

The rest of items are **pool items**. The amount of each item is the weight of the item. In the given example, coal has a weight of 4, and copper has a weight of 2, while the other items have a weight of 1.
