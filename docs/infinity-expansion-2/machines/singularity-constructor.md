# Singularity Constructor

Singularity Constructor is an electric machine that creates most [Singularities](/infinity-expansion-2/singularities).

## Usage

Once the machine is powered, you can input the items. Make sure the items are valid ingredients for the singularity you wish to construct. If the items are valid, the current singularity being constructed will be locked and displayed in the GUI. Once the singularity is locked, you cannot input any other items that are not the ingredients of the singularity until the progress is reset to 0.

If you want to reset the progress manually, simply break the machine. The first ingredient item which has the progress of 1 will be returned, that the number is equal to the current progress.

## Information

There are 2 tiers of Singularity Constructor:

| Tier | Speed* | Energy consumption (J/t) |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| Basic | 1x | 120 |
| Infinity | 64x | 1,200 |

- The **Speed** is how many items are taken per run.

:::info default values

Some of these information can be changed in the [item specific configurations](/infinity-expansion-2/config/items) by server owners. The wiki only shows the default values. Check the actual information in-game.
