# GEO Quarry

GEO Quarry is an electric machine that generates GEO resources from thin air.

## Usage

GEO Scan is not required, but you can scan the chunk to see what items are generated. GEO Quarry only generates items that have supply in the chunk.

## Information

There are 4 tiers of GEO Quarry:

| Tier | Speed | Output interval | Energy consumption (J/t) |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Basic | 1 | 400 | 450 |
| Infinity | 4 | 120 | 90_000 |

- The **Speed** is how many items are generated per output.

:::info default values

Some of these information can be changed in the [item specific configurations](/infinity-expansion-2/config/items) by server owners. The wiki only shows the default values. Check the actual information in-game.
