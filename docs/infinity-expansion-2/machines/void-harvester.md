# Void Harvester

Void Harvester is an electric machine that produces **Void Bit**.

## Information

There are 3 tiers of Void Harvester:

| Tier | Speed | Energy consumption (J/t) |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| Basic | 1 | 120 |
| Advanced | 8 | 1200 |
| Infinity | 64 | 12000 |

The default total progress is 1024. Each run increases the progress by **Speed**. Once the progress reaches the total progress, the machine will produce 1 Void Bit and reset the progress.

Some of these information can be changed in the [item specific configurations](/infinity-expansion-2/config/items) by server owners. The wiki only shows the default values. Check the actual information in-game.
