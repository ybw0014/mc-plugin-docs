# üåê Translation

InfinityExpansion2 has built-in localization support for almost everything.

## Changing your server language

You can change the language for your server by modifying [`config.yml`](/infinity-expansion-2/config/main).

## Changing your personal language

:::warning
This feature requires the server to have [SlimefunTranslation](/slimefun-translation/) installed.
:::

Every player can choose their preferred language. By default everyone will simply use the server's default language.
But if you have a lot of international players, they can simply override it and use their personally preferred language instead.

To do this, just go to the "Settings" section of your Slimefun Guide (Shift - Right Click the Slimefun Guide while holding it in your hand). There you should see a globe or a flag which allows you to select a language.


 The translation project is hosted on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/infinityexpansion2).

InfinityExpansion2 also supports [SlimefunTranslation](/slimefun-translation/) for per-player translation.
