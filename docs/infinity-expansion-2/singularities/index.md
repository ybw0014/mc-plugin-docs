# Singularities

Singularities are condensed by a large amount of resources. They are crafting ingredients of strong items.

Most singularities are crafted in [Singularity Constructor](/infinity-expansion-2/machines/singularity-constructor).

Unlike InfinityExpansion that only accepts 1 type of item as ingredients, InfinityExpansion 2 accepts multiple types of items as ingredients. To achieve this, we now display the total **progress** required to craft a singularity.

The singularity item guide page has a special layout. The top-middle item indicates the total progress. The bottom area lists all the possible ingredients, and their corresponding progress.

## Configuration

Server owners can modify the total progress of each singularity in the [item specific configurations](/infinity-expansion-2/config/items).

The final progress needed is calculated by multiply the total progress of the singularity by the [singularity cost multiplier](/infinity-expansion-2/config/main#singularity-cost-multiplier).
