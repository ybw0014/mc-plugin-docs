SlimefunTranslation utilizes PlaceholderAPI to provide placeholders for the translations. In this case, any available placeholders can be used in translations.

SlimefunTranslation also provides the following placeholders:

## SlimefunTranslation Lore

This placeholder covers most of the methods and strings provided by Slimefun's LoreBuilder. Other [translation files](/slimefun-translation/config/translations) may add more lore placeholders as well.

`%sftrlore_<Id>_<args>%`

The ID, is defined by the `lore` section in [translation files](/slimefun-translation/config/translations).  
The arguments are separated by an underscore (`_`).
