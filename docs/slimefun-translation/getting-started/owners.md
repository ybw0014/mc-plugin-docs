## Default translations

By default, the translations bundled in the plugin are all extracted to `translations` folder when the plugin is first installed.  
In the future startups, the plugin only extracts new translation files.

To update existing translation files, you will need to use the [translation extract command](/slimefun-translation/usage/commands-and-permissions#extract-translation-files).

After updating translations, use `/sftr translation reload` to reload all translations.

## Creating translations

Check out [making own translations](/slimefun-translation/config/translations#making-own-translations).
