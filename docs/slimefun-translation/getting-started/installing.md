SlimefunTranslation is a Slimefun Addon, so make sure you have installed Slimefun first. [Click here](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Installing-Slimefun) to learn how to install Slimefun.

### Dependencies

- [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4): Slimefun Dev 1131 or higher is **required**.
- [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/): **Required**. You may need to download the development version if you are on 1.20+.
- [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/): **Required**. We have used many placeholders in our default translations.

### Download

You can download from either page:

- Blob Builds, the official builds page for Slimefun and addons: [Click to go](https://blob.build/project/SlimefunTranslation/Dev)
- Guizhan Builds, my own builds page, all my addons are also available there: [![Build Status](https://builds.guizhanss.com/api/badge/ybw0014/SlimefunTranslation/master/latest)](https://builds.guizhanss.com/ybw0014/SlimefunTranslation/master)

The build number may be different on these 2 pages, because Blob Builds will not include failed builds. As long as they are latest on the page, they are supported.

## Installing

Once you downloaded the jar files of required plugins, put them into your server's `plugins` folder.

Then restart the server. SlimefunTranslation will begin the first installation.

:::warning Warning

Never use `/reload` command. It may cause unexpected issues.
