You want to see Bump be translated to more languages? Great.

Bump's localization service allows almost everything to be translated, including item names and lores.  
Our translation project is hosted at Crowdin: [Click to go](https://crowdin.com/project/slimefun-bump)  
Everyone is welcome to contribute to Bump's translation. If you cannot find your language, feel free to make a post in `#bump` at [Slimefun Addon Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SqD3gg5SAU).

Due to how the current recipe system works, only server admins (with config file access) can change the language of Bump. I would recommend you set the language before Bump is added to a live server.  
Players cannot change the language of Bump.
