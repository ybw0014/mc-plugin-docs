A Slimefun Addon that translates Slimefun items (also support addons) into different languages. It doesn't modify the actual item, instead, modifying the packets sent to the client.  
The displayed language is based on player's language setting in Slimefun, if the language is not supported, it will display in English.

### SlimefunTranslation Download

You can download from either page:

- Blob Builds, the official builds page for Slimefun and addons: [Click to go](https://blob.build/project/SlimefunTranslation/Dev)
- Guizhan Builds, my own builds page, all my addons are also available there: [![Build Status](https://builds.guizhanss.com/api/badge/ybw0014/SlimefunTranslation/master/latest)](https://builds.guizhanss.com/ybw0014/SlimefunTranslation/master)

The build number may be different on these 2 pages, because Blob Builds will not include failed builds. As long as they are latest on the page, they are supported.
