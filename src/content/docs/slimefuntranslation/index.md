title: Slimefun Translation
---

A Slimefun Addon that translates Slimefun items (also support addons) into different languages. It doesn't modify the actual item, instead, modifying the packets sent to the client. The displayed language is based on player's language setting in Slimefun, if the language is not supported, it will display in English.
