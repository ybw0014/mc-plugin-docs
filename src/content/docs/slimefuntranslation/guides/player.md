## Switching Item Language

The language of items is based on your language setting of Slimefun. You can hold Slimefun Guide and *Shift + Right Click* to open the settings menu. Then, click the language button to switch the language.

## Searching Items

When you use Slimefun's search function, you will not be able to find the items using the keyword in your language (if not English). This is because items aren't really translated on server side. You need to use SlimefunTranslation's search function to find the items.

Use `/sftr search <keyword>` to search for items, in your language.
