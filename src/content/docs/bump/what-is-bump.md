title: What is Bump?
---

Bump is a [Slimefun4](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4) addon that adds armor, food, weapons, and an appraisal system. You can get at most 10 stars for appraise results, through the appraisal system.

Bump was published by bxx2004 at mcbbs.net in 2020, and was rewritten by ybw0014 and haiman233 against Slimefun RC-30 in 2022.  
It added a localization system that allows Bump item names, descriptions, messages, and GUIs to be displayed in different languages, managed by server owners.
