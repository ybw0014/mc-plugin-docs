title: Quality Identifiers
---

Quality Identifiers are tools in Bump. There are three kinds of quality identifiers:

- Armor Quality Identifier
- Weapon Quality Identifier
- Horse Armor Quality Identifier

## Usage

Quality Identifiers can mark applicable equipment as appraisable, which means it can be appraised in [Appraisal Instrument](../items/appraisal-instrument).
For Armor and Weapon one, only Slimefun items are accepted. The Horse Armor one accepts any horse armor.
