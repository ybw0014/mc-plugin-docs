### Acceptable materials

This is different from [`Material`](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html). We do not need to type all the Materials here. Instead, we have both tags and materials.

Do we just write down the name of the Material? No. We write the `NamespacedKey` of Material.  
If you do not know what is `NamespacedKey`, no need to worry about.  
The `NamespacedKey` of Material is the lowercased Material with prefix `minecraft:`. For example, `STONE` should be written as `minecraft:stone`, `DIAMOND_SWORD` should be written as `minecraft:diamond_sword`.

What about tags? A tag is a set of Materials. You can just write a tag instead of writing all Materials within it.  
Bump defined a series of tags for you to use.
To use a tag, write its lowercased name with prefix `bump:`. For example, `axe` is the tag that covers all axes, you will need to write `bump:axe` when you using it.  
You can find all tags in our GitHub repository: [Click to go](https://github.com/SlimefunGuguProject/Bump/tree/main/src/main/resources/tags)

### Permission

The permission will be checked when a player selects a specified appraise type in Appraisal Instrument, or clicks on **Appraise** button in Appraisal Instrument.

### Attribute

About the weight of attributes:

- The appraise type will not be registered if all attributes' weights are specified, but the overall weight is not 100.
- All attributes with unspeficied weights will divide the remaining weight.
- `-1` weight means an unspeficied weight.
- If you do not want an attribute value to be calculated in star rate, you need to set it to 0, instead of removing the weight.

About the values of attributesï¼š

- The maximum value must be equal to or greater than the minimum value. Otherwise, the appraise type will not be registered.
- The attributes will be applied to equipment by `AttributeModifier`. The [operations](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Attribute#Operations) of `GENERIC_MOVEMENT_SPEED` and `HORSE_JUMP_STRENGTH` are **multiply_base**. The operations of other attributes are all **add**.
